# My Code Sandbox

This repository contains various code snippets and programs I created or used the help of AI to create for different projects and experiments. Please note that these are not necessarily well-documented or polished, as they were created for personal use or late-night caffeine-fueled coding sessions.

Feel free to explore, use, or modify any of the code you find here for your own projects. If you find anything useful, consider contributing to the open-source community by making it public domain or applying an open-source license.
